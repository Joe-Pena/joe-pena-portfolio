    <h1>ABOUT JOE</h1>
    <p>
      Although I was born in the United States, I spent the majority of my life
      in northen Mexico. At age 15, I decided to move back to the states, where
      I live now. <br />
      <br />
      After graduating High School, I made the decision to get a career path
      into technology, starting to self teach at the age of 17, and after many
      long and hard hours of studying and consistent effort, I am now a
      fullstack software engineer, and I'm always looking forward to working in
      efficient and cooperative development teams. <br />
      <br />
      During my free time, I enjoy exploring the great fourteeners of colorado,
      shooting arrows in the archery range, and performing music as a hobby, as
      well as collecting a great amount of classics from the 60s to the 80s,
      with vynils from iconic names such as David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, and
      Hall & Oates.
