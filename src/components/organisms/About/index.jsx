    <h1>ABOUT JOE</h1>
    <p>
      Although I was born in the United States, I spent the majority of my life
      in northen Mexico. At age 15, I decided to move back to the states, where
      I live now. <br />
      <br />
      I've been a big fan of technology since a young age, and truly believe it
      is what will change our lives in the near coming future, and so I'm happy
      to be able to work in a field that allows for the innovation of
      technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm very passionate about learning new methods and technologies in the
      field, and always look forward to collaborating with others to find
      effective and elegant solutions to tough problems.
      <br />

      During my free time, I enjoy exploring the great fourteeners of colorado,
      shooting arrows in the archery range, and performing music as a hobby, as
      well as collecting a great amount of classics from the 60s to the 80s,
      with vynils from iconic names such as David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, and
      Hall & Oates.
