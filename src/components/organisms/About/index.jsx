    <h1>ABOUT JOE</h1>
    <p>
      Although I was born in the United States, I spent the majority of my life
      in Northen Mexico, in Chihuahua. At age 15, I decided to move back to the
      states, just to look around and see how everything is over here, and what
      do you know, I liked it enough that I stayed! <br />
      <br />
      I've been a big fan of technology since a young age, it started with me
      playing games on an old Super NES and thinking "Wow, I can move what's on
      the TV", then througout the years I saw the improvements on the same
      technology that was showing me Mario on the screen, and it blew my mind
      right out of my face.
      <br />
      <br />
      Come today, and it's amazing to think about exactly how fast technology
      has progressed in just a decade alone, and I wanted to be a part of that
      progress, so here I am, as a Software Engineer, doing what I can, getting
      together with other engineers and building great things with just a
      computer, it's crazy!
      <br />
      <br />
      During my free time, I enjoy exploring the mountains of Colorado, shooting
      arrows in the archery range, and performing music as a hobby, as well as
      collecting a great amount of classics from the 60s to the 80s, with vynils
      from iconic names such as David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, and Hall &
      Oates.
